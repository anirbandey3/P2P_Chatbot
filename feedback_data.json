It streamlines the process from invoice entry and validation to payment processing and reconciliation, improving efficiency and accuracy.  Key features include:\n\n* **Invoice Processing:**  Payables handles various invoice types, including standard, prepayment, credit memos, and recurring invoices.  It offers flexible options for invoice entry, such as manual entry, electronic data interchange (EDI), and optical character recognition (OCR).\n* **Payment Processing:**  Payables supports multiple payment methods, including checks, electronic funds transfers (EFTs), and wire transfers.  It provides robust controls for payment authorization and reconciliation.\n* **Reporting and Analysis:**  Payables offers a wide range of reports and analysis tools to track invoice and payment activity, manage supplier relationships, and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs).\n* **Integration:**  Payables seamlessly integrates with other Oracle E-Business Suite modules, such as Purchasing, General Ledger, and Fixed Assets.\n\nWithin Payables, two key workbenches facilitate these processes:\n\n1. **Invoice Workbench:**  This is the primary interface for entering, adjusting, and reviewing invoices and invoice batches.\n2. **Payment Manager:**  This workbench is used to create, adjust, and review payments and payment batches.\n\n> Payables includes two fully integrated workbenches, the Invoice Workbench and the Payment Manager.
